# Automobile Price Prediction

## 1. Background

This project focuses on predicting the price of used automobiles. The key steps involved in the project include:

* Loading the data
* Preprocessing the data
* Exploring features to predict the car prices
* Developing prediction models
* Evaluating and refining these models

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Data

The dataset utilized in this project is the [Automobile Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/premptk/automobile-data-changed) from Kaggle.

### 2.2. Data Preprocessing 

#### Identifying and Handling Missing Values
It's essential to detect and address any missing values in the dataset to ensure accurate model predictions.

#### Correcting Data Formats
Ensuring all data entries are in the correct format is crucial for seamless data analysis and model training.

### 2.3. Feature Engineering

#### Data Standardization
Standardizing the data helps in bringing all features to a common scale, which improves the model's performance.

#### Data Normalization
Normalizing the data ensures that the values are within a specific range, typically 0 to 1, which helps in faster convergence during model training.

#### Binning
Binning is the process of converting numerical values into categorical ones, which can enhance the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.

### 2.4. Data Exploration
Exploring the data to understand the relationships between various features and the target variable (car price) is a crucial step in building effective prediction models.
